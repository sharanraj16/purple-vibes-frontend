# 💜 Purple Vibes – Share Your World

![Purple Vibes UI](src/assets/amiresponsive.png)


**Purple Vibes** is a full-stack social web application where users can express themselves by sharing stories, images, and experiences. The platform is designed to encourage interaction, creativity, and community-building in a visually engaging and secure environment.

🎉 This project is my **final milestone submission** for the [Code Institute Full-Stack Developer Program](https://codeinstitute.net), built using the **MERN-adjacent stack** (React + Flask + MongoDB). It is a fully responsive, interactive app built with scalability and user engagement in mind.
